        I am an avid gamer, a self-proclaimed animal lover, and a passionate coder. I have grown up in Southern California all my life raised by parents fleeing from war. Worrying about my upbringing my parents sheltered me at home my entire childhood. Growing up I had friends but I never really went out and often times pour all my free time in playing video games, browsing the internet, and tinkering with computers.
